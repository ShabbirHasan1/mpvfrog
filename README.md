# mpvfrog üê∏
Linux GUI frontend for mpv

## Features

- Custom demuxers

	Define your own custom demuxers for different file types.
	For example, you could use fluidsynth to demux midi files.

## Why?
I really like mpv.
It supports all the formats and has all the features I want, including speeding up and slowing down music on the fly.
(I am a musical pervert who likes to do that.)
All I need is a nice gui for picking songs with a single click.

## Why not libmpv?
I was mostly just curious about how far I could go just wrapping the system mpv process.
I might use libmpv in the future, but for my personal needs, this is sufficient.
