# mpv-egui-musicplayer
Small personal music player wrapping mpv

## Why?
I really like mpv.
It supports all the formats and has all the features I want, including speeding up and slowing down music on the fly.
(I am a musical pervert who likes to do that.)
All I need is a nice gui for picking songs with a single click.

## Why not libmpv?
I was mostly just curious about how far I could go just wrapping the system mpv process.
I might use libmpv in the future, but for my personal needs, this is sufficient.
